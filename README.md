  The Gaming Room client sought to create a web application that would enable teams to input their answers based on what they observed. Initially developed for Android, the client aimed to expand the application to a web platform to increase accessibility for a broader audience. The design of this application was inspired by the classic 1980s game “Win, Lose or Draw.” Additionally, the client expressed a desire to develop this project within their budget constraints. 
  I believe to have done well in understanding and articulating the client’s vision for their game, particularly regarding the primary requirements. This made me have some issues during the coding process, as having a clear and concise list of requirements allowed me to effectively navigate and implement the necessary features. Providing a simple list can help clarify the various aspects of developing for different operating platforms. It is essential to recognize that much of the work may require extensive editing; however, one critical area that stands out is understanding the pros and cons associated with each platform. This understanding is vital as it highlights potential challenges and considerations that developers must be aware of when creating applications or software. By carefully evaluating these factors, developers can make informed decisions that enhance their projects’ effectiveness and usability.
  In designing software, it is crucial to keep the user’s needs at the forefront of the process. This involves constantly considering how users will react to the design choices made. The primary goal is to adopt the user’s mentality, as disregarding their needs undermines the purpose of the project. If a software application is too difficult for users to navigate, it risks attracting less traffic, which can ultimately lead to financial losses for clients who maintain the site. Therefore, one of the first considerations in software design should be ensuring that the project is storage and memory efficient. Software that consumes excessive resources can lead to significant operational issues. To facilitate this process, writing pseudocode can be an effective strategy; it helps clarify thought processes and plans before actual coding begins. Additionally, running unit tests and debugging are essential steps in ensuring that the project functions correctly and meets user expectations.
